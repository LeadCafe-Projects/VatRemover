# SendGrid Sender Verification Issue

## Problem
SendGrid is rejecting all sender addresses with the error: "The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity."

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Your Verified Senders
Go to your SendGrid dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication → Single Sender Verification
- Look for which specific email address shows as "Verified" 
- The email address must match EXACTLY

### 2. Common Verified Addresses
Based on your screenshot, you likely have one of these verified:
- `josh@leadcafe.co.za` (most likely)
- `noreply@vatremover.co.za`
- `support@vatremover.co.za`
- `hello@vatremover.co.za`

### 3. Quick Fix
In your SendGrid dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Click "Verify a Single Sender"
3. Add exactly: `josh@leadcafe.co.za`
4. Check your email and click the verification link

### 4. Test Email
Once verified, the server will automatically detect the working sender and emails will be delivered to josh@leadcafe.co.za

## Current Status
- Domain Authentication: ✅ Verified
- Single Sender: ❌ Specific email address needs verification
- API Key: ✅ Working
- Email Delivery: ⏳ Pending sender verification

## Next Steps
1. Verify the specific sender email address
2. Test feedback form on Replit domain
3. Check josh@leadcafe.co.za inbox for delivery

## Overview

This is a VAT (Value Added Tax) calculator application specifically designed for South Africa, where the VAT rate is 15%. The application allows users to quickly remove VAT from inclusive amounts and provides both the exclusive amount and the VAT portion. It's built as a full-stack web application with React frontend and Express backend, though currently functions primarily as a static calculator tool.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system with Radix UI primitives

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Session Management**: Basic structure in place for user sessions

### Build Configuration
- **Client Build**: Vite builds to `dist/public` directory
- **Server Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Development**: Concurrent client and server development with HMR support

## Key Components

### VAT Calculator Logic
- Real-time calculation of VAT-exclusive amounts from VAT-inclusive totals
- Uses the formula: `exclusiveAmount = inclusiveAmount / 1.15`
- Automatic calculation as user types
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for results

### UI Components
- Professional calculator interface with clear input/output display
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Share functionality for social media platforms
- Modal dialogs for additional information

### Advertisement Integration
- Google AdSense integration configured
- Placeholder system for development
- Multiple ad placement zones (banner, sidebar, mobile)

### SEO Optimization
- Comprehensive meta tags for search engines
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets
- Canonical URLs and proper heading structure

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters VAT-inclusive amount in input field
2. **Real-time Calculation**: React useEffect triggers calculation on input change
3. **Result Display**: Shows VAT-exclusive amount and VAT portion separately
4. **Copy Functionality**: Users can copy results to clipboard
5. **Share Integration**: Social sharing options for WhatsApp, email, and social platforms

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives via shadcn/ui

### Database Preparation

- **Database Driver**: Neon serverless database driver
- **Schema**: Basic user schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit configured for schema management

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with React plugin and runtime error overlay
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Code Quality**: ESLint-ready configuration structure

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Deployment (Current Primary Method)
- **Target**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Build Output**: `dist/public` contains all static assets
- **Redirects**: SPA routing handled via `_redirects` file
- **Domain**: Configured for `vatremover.co.za`

### Full-Stack Deployment (Replit)
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment target
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 module enabled
- **Build Process**: Builds both client and server components
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, externally exposed on port 80

### Alternative Deployments
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Wrangler configuration for serverless deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployment guide provided for static hosting
- **Manual Deployment**: Build scripts for custom hosting solutions

  <h1>15% VAT Remover – Instantly Remove VAT from Any Total</h1>

  <h2>What Is VAT and Why Use a VAT Remover?</h2>
  <p>
    Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied to the sale of goods and services in South Africa. Introduced in 1991, the current standard VAT rate stands at <strong>15%</strong>, as regulated by the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This tax applies to most everyday purchases and business transactions, though some items are either zero-rated or VAT-exempt.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>VAT remover</strong> helps you work backwards from a total amount that includes VAT to determine the original price before tax. This process, known as <strong>removing VAT</strong>, is essential for individuals and businesses who need clarity on the net price of a product or service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our <strong>VAT removal tool</strong> is designed to do just that: quickly and accurately calculate the amount before VAT—especially relevant when <strong>removing VAT in South Africa</strong> at the 15% rate.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Calculate the Amount Before VAT</h2>
  <p>To remove 15% VAT from any total, use this simple formula:</p>
  <p><strong>Amount excluding VAT = Total (including VAT) ÷ 1.15</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    If your total is <strong>R1,150</strong> and you want to know the price before tax:<br>
    R1,150 ÷ 1.15 = <strong>R1,000</strong> (net amount)<br>
    R1,150 – R1,000 = <strong>R150</strong> (VAT portion)
  </p>
  <p>
    This reverse VAT calculation is what our <strong>VAT remover tool</strong> automates—instantly providing accurate results without the manual maths.

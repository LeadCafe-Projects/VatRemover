# SendGrid Email Setup for VAT Calculator Feedback

## Current Status
✅ **SendGrid API key is configured and working**
✅ **Feedback form is functional and logging all submissions**
⚠️ **Email delivery requires domain verification**

## To Enable Email Delivery

### Step 1: Domain Verification (Recommended)
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/) → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
3. Enter your domain: `vatremover.co.za`
4. Add the provided DNS records to your domain:
   - CNAME records for DKIM
   - TXT record for SPF
5. Click "Verify" once DNS records are propagated

### Step 2: Update SendGrid Code
Once domain verification is complete, update `server/sendgrid.ts`:

1. Uncomment the SendGrid email sending code (lines 31-57)
2. Comment out the logging code (lines 18-26)
3. Update the `from` field to use your verified domain:
   ```typescript
   from: 'noreply@vatremover.co.za'
   ```

### Alternative: Single Sender Verification (Quick Setup)
If you don't have DNS access:
1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Click "Create a Single Sender"
3. Use: `noreply@vatremover.co.za`
4. Complete verification through email confirmation
